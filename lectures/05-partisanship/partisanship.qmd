# Partisanship and Ideology

## Elites vs Citizens

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Political [**elites**]{.alert}:

-   Know and care a lot about politics
-   Operate in institional settings with clear incentives
-   Can be modeled as rational actors with consistent preferences who optimize their behavior to achieve their goals
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
[**Ordinary Citizens**]{.alert}:

-   Do not know or care about politics
-   Much of their political behavior occurs in unstructured contexts in which their actions are not individually consequential and their goals/incentives are unclear.
-   Their opinions and behavior are often best analyzed using *psychological* rather than rationalist models.

## What Have We Learned from Survey Data? {.center}

Relative to political elites, citizens’ attitudes are:

-   [Ignorant]{.alert}: Citizens lack basic information about politics.
-   [Unstable]{.alert}: Citizens’ attitudes are often inconsistent and unstable.
-   [Unconstrained]{.alert}: Citizens are much less ideological or consistent

## How Voters Talk

> "When we first did that big trade agreement I thought it was a good idea, but now I’m getting a little more conservative about it,” said Phyllis Arthur, a 74-year-old Republican from Walnut Creek, Calif. “I think we’re being overwhelmed by the goods coming in. That’s practically all that’s available in the stores."[^1]

Voters will also answer almost any question you ask them: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_22Y-K4wtzo)

## Inconsistent Opinions, but Stable Partisanship?

-   Despite this inconsistency, voters actual votes are quite predictable.

-   The vast majority of Americans to vote consistent with their party identification, which is itself quite stable over time.
