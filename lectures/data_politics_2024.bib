  abstract = {We document a large and consequential bias in how Americans perceive the major political parties: people tend to considerably overestimate the extent to which party supporters belong to party-stereotypical groups. For instance, people think that 32\% of Democrats are LGBT (vs. 6\% in reality) and 38\% of Republicans earn over \$250,000 per year (vs. 2\% in reality). Experimental data suggest that these misperceptions are genuine and party specific, not artifacts of expressive responding, innumeracy, or ignorance of base rates. These misperceptions are widely shared, though bias in out-party perceptions is larger. Using observational and experimental data, we document the consequences of this perceptual bias. Misperceptions about out-party composition are associated with partisan affect, beliefs about out-party extremity, and allegiance to one’s own party. When provided information about the out-party’s actual composition, partisans come to see its supporters as less extreme and feel less socially distant from them.},

In a randomized experiment, we find that deactivating Facebook for the four weeks before the 2018 US midterm election (i) reduced online activity, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political polarization; (iii) increased subjective well-being; and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in post-experiment Facebook use. Deactivation reduced post-experiment valuations of Facebook, suggesting that traditional metrics may overstate consumer surplus.},

Here, we show that a single approximately 10-minute conversation encouraging actively taking the perspective of others can markedly reduce prejudice for at least 3 months. We illustrate this potential with a door-to-door canvassing intervention in South Florida targeting antitransgender prejudice. Despite declines in homophobia, transphobia remains pervasive. For the intervention, 56 canvassers went door to door encouraging active perspective-taking with 501 voters at voters’ doorsteps. A randomized trial found that these conversations substantially reduced transphobia, with decreases greater than Americans’ average decrease in homophobia from 1998 to 2012. These effects persisted for 3 months, and both transgender and nontransgender canvassers were effective. The intervention also increased support for a nondiscrimination law, even after exposing voters to counterarguments.},

The Citrin Award Lecture is an annual event of the Jack Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research (https://citrincenter.berkeley.edu). The Citrin Award recognizes the career of an individual who has made significant contributions to the study and understanding of public opinion. The honoree is selected by the Executive Committee of the Center and is invited to deliver a lecture in recognition of this Award.  Cohn's talk, "Where Polling Stands Heading into 2024," provides an overview of the polling landscape as of October 2023. He provided an account of the challenges facing pollsters and reported on the current state of the Biden v. Trump race: a dead heat. ABOUT THE SPEAKER Nate Cohn is the New York Times‘ chief political analyst. He is widely recognized for his expertise in deciphering the complex landscape of American public opinion and elections. At the Times, he plays a pivotal role in providing insightful commentary on elections, polling, and demographic trends through his contributions to The Upshot. His Siena College/New York Times Upshot Poll has also earned a reputation for being one of the most accurate polls nationwide.  With a passion for making data-driven analysis accessible to the public, Cohn’s articles in the Times have both broken new ground in our understanding of American politics and made data-driven political analysis accessible and understandable to the American public. His rigorous analyses have earned him a reputation as one of the most trusted voices in the field of political journalism. In addition to his written work, Nate Cohn has become a sought-after commentator on major news networks such as CNN, MSNBC, and C-SPAN. His appearances on NPR and engagements at prestigious colleges and universities have further cemented his status as a leading authority on U.S. politics. Prior to joining The New York Times in 2013, Cohn honed his analytical skills as a staff writer for The New Republic and as a research associate at The Henry L. Stimson Center.}

But what are the limits of partisan loyalty? How much electoral leeway do co-partisan candidates have to deviate from the party line on important issues? We answer this question using conjoint survey experiments that characterize the role of partisanship relative to issues. We demonstrate a pattern of conditional party loyalty. Partisanship dominates electoral choice when elections center on low-salience issues. But while partisan loyalty is strong, it is finite: the average voter is more likely than not to vote for the co-partisan candidate until that candidate takes dissonant stances on four or more salient issues. These findings illuminate when and why partisanship fails to dominate political choice. They also suggest that, on many issues, public opinion minimally constrains politicians.},

Building on Pettigrew and Tropp's (2006) influential meta-analysis, we assemble all intergroup contact studies that feature random assignment and delayed outcome measures, of which there are 27 in total, nearly two-thirds of which were published following the original review. We find the evidence from this updated dataset to be consistent with Pettigrew and Tropp's (2006) conclusion that contact “typically reduces prejudice.” At the same time, our meta-analysis suggests that contact's effects vary, with interventions directed at ethnic or racial prejudice generating substantially weaker effects. Moreover, our inventory of relevant studies reveals important gaps, most notably the absence of studies addressing adults' racial or ethnic prejudices, an important limitation for both theory and policy. We also call attention to the lack of research that systematically investigates the scope conditions suggested by Allport (1954) under which contact is most influential. We conclude that these gaps in contact research must be addressed empirically before this hypothesis can reliably guide policy.},

  abstract = {Surveys are an essential approach for eliciting otherwise invisible factors such as perceptions, knowledge and beliefs, attitudes, and reasoning. These factors are critical determinants of social, economic, and political outcomes. Surveys are not merely a research tool. They are also not only a way of collecting data. Instead, they involve creating the process that will generate the data. This allows the researcher to create their own identifying and controlled variation. Thanks to the rise of mobile technologies and platforms, surveys offer valuable opportunities either to study broadly representative samples or to focus on specific groups. This article offers guidance on the complete survey process, from the design of the questions and experiments to the recruitment of respondents and the collection of data to the analysis of survey responses. It covers issues related to the sampling process, selection and attrition, attention and carelessness, survey question design and measurement, response biases, and survey experiments.},
