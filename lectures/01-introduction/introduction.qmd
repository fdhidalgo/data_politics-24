## Research Design

This class is about [research design]{.alert}, which is a blend of:

-   Theory and substantive knowledge
-   Craft
-   Statistics
-   Computation

. . .

In particular, we will focus on the design and analysis of [randomized experiments]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"} and [survey samples]{.fg style="--col: #5d41e6"}.

## Design Based Inference

Randomized experiments and surveys are examples of [design based inference]{.alert}.

. . .

We will learn to:

-   Read and critique scientific papers that use these approaches
-   Understand the statistical theory underpinning this mode of inference
-   Analyze experimental and survey data using modern statistical computing tools
-   Design and implement our own studies

## Experiments and Surveys

|                                        | [Experiments]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"} | [Surveys]{.fg style="--col: #5d41e6"} |
|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| [Target of Inference]{.alert}          | Counterfactuals                           | Out of Sample Observations            |
| [Threats to Internal Validity]{.alert} | Omitted Variable Bias                     | Non-Response                          |
| [Selection Mechanism]{.alert}          | Random Assignment                         | Random Sampling                       |
| [Threats to External Validity]{.alert} | Lack of Realism                           | Measurement Error                     |
| [Statistical Analysis]{.alert}         | Modeling                                  | Weighting                             |

## Computation: ![](images/Rlogo.png){width="75"} + ![](./images/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png){width="150"}

-   We will use the [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) statistical environment to analyze data.

    -   It's free.
    -   Excellent for data analysis and visualization.
    -   Rich ecosystem of packages for social science and statistics.
    -   Infrastructure for inter-mingling code, data, and text.

-   Used extensively in Academia, media, and industry

-   We will use [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com) as our development environment.
