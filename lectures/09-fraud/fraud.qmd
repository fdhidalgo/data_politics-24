Election judge:


>  We had the law to ourselves there. It was a lawless son-of-a-bitch. We had iron control. If a man was opposed to us, we’d put him out of business. Parr was the godfather. He had life or death control... We could tell any election judge: ‘Give us 80 per cent of the vote, the other guy 20 per cent.’ We had it made in every election

## List Experiment in Colombia

> I will read a list of five (5) things people have in mind when deciding who to vote for. I want you to tell me how many of these five things you have taken into account when voting for a candidate. Do not tell me WHICH, ONLY HOW MANY.” Then they are handed a card with the following options

1. The information about the candidate on the radio or television,
2. What you read about his or her government plan,
3. **The benefits, gifts, or jobs the candidate offered you in exchange for your vote**
4. The conversations you had with your friends about the candidate,
5. The candidate’s party.

## Experimental Design

![](images/gm_design.png)

## Factorial Design

- Example of a **factorial** design

- Two factors (treatments):
  - Type of ad
  - Letter or no letter
  
. . . 

| | Letter | No Letter |
|---|---|---|
| Information | Letter & Information | No Letter & Information |
| Call-to-Action | Letter & Call-to-Action | No Letter & Call-to-Action |
|Info & Call-to-Action | Letter & Info & Call-to-Action | No Letter & Info & Call-to-Action |

## Stratification

> To increase the balance on potential confounders across treatment conditions, we conducted a stratified randomization. We defined strata by the intersection of bins partitioning the sample in three ways: (i) by the fiftieth and eighty-fifth percentiles of the population over the age of 18, (ii) by the twentieth and eightieth percentiles of voter turnout in the first round of presidential elections in 2018, and (iii) by whether the municipalities filed reports through the MOE’s website around the congressional elections of 2018 above or below the median

## Clustering

- Level of randomization: municipalities
- Dependent variables: 
  - Reports of irregularities (698 municipalities)
  - Deviations from Benford's Law (698 municipalities)
  - Candidates' vote share (**2,989** candidates)

- What is the sample size? 

## Effect on Reports

## Effects on Candidates' Vote Share

![](images/gm_effect_cand.png)


## Cost Effectiveness

- Total FB campaign: $10,870
- Total cost of $15 per municipality
- Reduced vote share of "corrupt" candidates by 2.5 percentage points
- Average votes in each municipality is 13,352
- Number of votes changed on average: (13,352 x 2.5% ) $\approx$ 330 
- Every $1  spent reduced about 21 votes for "corrupt" candidates
