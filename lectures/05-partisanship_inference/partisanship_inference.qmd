# Partisanship and Ideology

## Elites vs Citizens

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Political [**elites**]{.alert}: 

- Know and care a lot about politics
- Operate in institional settings with clear incentives
- Can be modeled as rational actors with consistent preferences who optimize their behavior to achieve their goals


:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

[**Ordinary Citizens**]{.alert}:

- Do not know or care about politics
- Much of their political behavior occurs in unstructured contexts in which their actions are not individually consequential and their goals/incentives are unclear.
- Their opinions and behavior are often best analyzed using *psychological* rather than rationalist models.

## What Have We Learned from Survey Data? {.center}

Relative to political elites, citizens’ attitudes are:

- [Ignorant]{.alert}: Citizens lack basic information about politics.
- [Unstable]{.alert}: Citizens’ attitudes are often inconsistent and unstable.
- [Unconstrained]{.alert}: Citizens are much less ideological or consistent

## How Voters Talk  

> "When we first did that big trade agreement I thought it was a good idea, but now I’m getting a little more conservative about it,” said Phyllis Arthur, a 74-year-old Republican from Walnut Creek, Calif. “I think we’re being overwhelmed by the goods coming in. That’s practically all that’s available in the stores."^[[NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/business/economy/trade-donald-trump-bernie-sanders.html)]


. . . 

Voters will also answer almost any question you ask them: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_22Y-K4wtzo)

## Inconsistent Opinions, but Stable Partisanship? 

- Despite this inconsistency, voters actual votes are quite predictable. 

- The vast majority of Americans to vote consistent with their party identification, which is itself quite stable over time.

## Partisanship and Ideology

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}

While partisanship is mostly stable, the correlation between partisanship and ideology has increased, especially among elites.

## Ideological Sorting 

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}

Ideological sorting among citizens has also increased, but not as much as among elites.

## What Comes First? 

Increasing correlation beteen partisanship and ideology among elites and citizens. Why? 

. . . 

- Citizens polarize and then elites follow
- Elites polarize and then citizens follow

. . .

Barber and Pope (2018) is designed to inform this debate by using a party leaders' shifting [stances](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/full-list-donald-trump-s-rapidly-changing-policy-positions-n547801). 

## Survey Experiment

::: nonincremental
- Randomized treatment embedded in a 2017 survey
- Treatment arms:
  - Control group (500 respondents)
  - Liberal Trump (200 respondents)
  - Conservative Trump (200 respondents)

# Inference: Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis Testing {.center}

:::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

- We have discussed estimation of ATEs and how the difference-in-means is *over repeated randomizations* an unbiased estimator of the ATE.

- But any particular estimate may be close or far from the true ATE.

- How do we know if our finding is unlikely to have occurred by chance?

## Logic of Hypothesis Testing

- We start with an imagined world in which the treatment has a particular effect: [the **null hypothesis**]{.alert}

- We ask: under our maintained assumptions, how likely is it that we would observe the data we have if the null hypothesis were true?
  - *Important*: It is not the probability that any partifcular hypothesis is true, but the probability of observing the data we have if the null hypothesis were true. 

- If the probability is low, we [**reject**]{.alert} the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. 😎
- If the probability is high, we [**fail to reject**]{.alaert} the null hypothesis. 😢
  - We do not accept the null hypothesis, we just fail to reject it.

## The Sharp Null

In experiments, we might be interested in the [**sharp null hypothesis**]{.alert}:

. . .

::: {.callout-note title="Sharp Null Hypotheis of No Effect"}

The treatment effect is 0 for all units: $Y_i(1)=Y_i(0)$ for all $i$. 

:::

**Key idea:** in the world where the sharp null hypothesis is true, we observe all the potential outcomes!

**The Real World**

| $i$  |  $D_i$  | $Y_i(0)$  |  $Y_i(1)$  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  1 | 1  | ? |  1 |
|  2 | 0  | -1 | ?  |
|  3 | 1  | ? |  0 |

**The Sharp Null World**

| $i$  |  $D_i$  | $Y_i(0)$  |  $Y_i(1)$  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  1 | 1  | 1 |  1 |
|  2 | 0  | -1 | -1  |
|  3 | 1  | 0 |  0 |

## Sampling Distribution Under the Sharp Null


- To conduct a hypothesis test, we need to know the distribution of our estimator (the difference-in-means) under the sharp null hypothesis.
- We can do this by:
  1. Calculate the actual difference-in-means in our sample.
  2. Permute the treatment assignment the same way you originally assigned treatment and calculate the difference-in-means.
  3. Repeat step 2 many times.
  4. Compare the actual difference-in-means to the distribution of differences-in-means under the sharp null.
  5. The p-value is the proportion of permuted differences-in-means that are as extreme or more extreme than the actual difference-in-means.
