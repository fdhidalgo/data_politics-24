## What is a Causal Effect?

-   Students with diverse friend groups express less discriminatory attitudes and are supportive of policies that promote diversity.
    -   Would these students be supportive of these policies if they did not have diverse friend groups?

. . .

-   Heavy social media users are less happy on average than those who use social media less.
    -   Is this because social media use causes unhappiness, or are unhappy people more likely to use social media?

## The Effect of Social Media

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/facebook_grannies.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Much concern about the effect of social media on:
    -   Mental health
    -   Political polarization
    -   Interactions with friends and families
:::
:::

. . .

Imagine two respondents:

| Respondent | Social Media Use | Happiness |
|------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1          | High             | Low       |
| 2          | Low              | High      |

. . .

[Did social media use cause the difference in happiness?]{.alert}

## Some notation

The **causal** or **treatment** variable is:

$$
T_i= \begin{cases} 1 & \text { if respondent } i \text { used social media } \\ 0 & \text { if respondent } i \text { did not use social media }\end{cases}
$$

The *observed* **outcome** variable is:

$$
Y_i= \begin{cases} 1 & \text { if respondent } i \text { is happy } \\ 0 & \text { if respondent } i \text { is unhappy }\end{cases}
$$

. . .

So now, are data becomes:

| Respondent | $T_i$ | $Y_i$ |
|------------|-------|-------|
| 1          | 1     | 0     |
| 2          | 0     | 1     |

## Causal Effects & Counterfactuals

How do we translate "what if" questions into a mathematical language?

. . .

::: incremental
-   Two **potential outcomes**:
    -   $Y_i(1)$: the outcome for respondent $i$ if they used social media
    -   $Y_i(0)$: the outcome for respondent $i$ if they did not use social media
:::

. . .

::: incremental
-   Causal effect for person $i$: [$Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$]{.fg style="--col: #5d41e6"}
    -   $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) = 0$ $\rightarrow$ no effect
    -   $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) = 1$ $\rightarrow$ Social media causes happiness
    -   $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) = -1$ $\rightarrow$ Social media causes unhappiness
:::

## Potential Outcomes

| Respondent | $T_i$ | $Y_i$ | $Y_i(0)$ | $Y_i(1)$ |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1          | 1     | 0     | ?        | 0        |
| 2          | 0     | 1     | 1        | ?        |

[**Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**]{.alert}

-   We only observe one of the potential outcomes
-   Observe $Y_i(1)$ if $T_i=1$ and $Y_i(0)$ if $T_i=0$

## Average Treatment Effects

Because we cannot observe individual causal effects, we often focus on the **Average Treatment Effect** (ATE):

$$ \text{ATE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)) $$

. . .

The **ATE** compares the average outcome when everyone is treated to the average outcome when no one is treated.

. . .

**Can we observe the ATE?**

## Comparing Groups

Imagine the following dataset:

| Respondent | $T_i$ | $Y_i$ | $Y_i(0)$ | $Y_i(1)$ |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1          | 1     | 0     | ?        | 0        |
| 2          | 0     | 1     | 1        | ?        |
| 3          | 1     | 0     | ?        | 0        |
| 4          | 0     | 1     | 1        | ?        |

. . .

We might [estimate]{.alert} the ATE from this data by comparing the average **observed** outcome for those who used social media to those who did not:

$$ \textrm{Difference in Means} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \cdot T_i}{ \sum_{i=1}^N T_i} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \cdot (1-T_i)}{ \sum_{i=1}^N 1-T_i} $$

In our case, the *estimated* ATE would be: [**-1**]{.alert}

## Counfounding

Now imagine we could observe the potential outcomes for each respondent:

| $i$ | $T_i$ | $Y_i$ | $Y_i(0)$                 | $Y_i(1)$                 | $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 1   | 1     | 0     | [0]{style="color:blue;"} | 0                        | 0                 |
| 2   | 0     | 1     | 1                        | [1]{style="color:blue;"} | 0                 |
| 3   | 1     | 0     | 0                        | [0]{style="color:blue;"} | 0                 |
| 4   | 0     | 1     | [1]{style="color:blue;"} | 1                        | 0                 |

. . .

Even though our *estimated* ATE is -1, the true ATE is 0. Why?

. . .

There is an association between the treatment variable and potential outcomes, but it is not causal.

In our example, social media users are less happy, but this is not because of social media use $\rightarrow$ the comparison across groups is *confounded*.

## Randomization {.center}

We will discuss in more detail later, but key idea is that **random assignment** of a treatment *breaks* the association between treatment and potential outcomes.

This allows for *unconfounded* comparisons across groups.

## Facebook Cessation Experiment {{< fa brands facebook >}}

@allcottWelfareEffectsSocial2020 presents a randomized experiment where half of around 2,800 Facebook users were paid about \$100 to deactivate their accounts for a month.

What do they find?

. . .

Facebook cessation:

::: incremental
-   Freed up on average of 60 minutes per day
-   Led to spending less time online and more time with friends and family
-   Resulted in 15% decrease in news consumption; also decreased knowledge of politics
-   Resulted in less extreme political opinions
-   Caused small improvements in subjective wellbeing

## R and RStudio

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/r-logo.png){fig-alt="R logo" fig-align="center"}

-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
-   It's easily extensible with *packages*
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
![](images/rstudio-logo.png){fig-alt="RStudio logo"}

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
-   RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists

## R packages {.center}

::: incremental
-   **Packages**: Fundamental units of reproducible R code, including reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.

-   As of 15 January 2023, there are 20,252 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).

-   We're going to work with a small subset of these.

## Tour recap: R + RStudio

![](images/tour-r-rstudio.png)

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

-   Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

. . .

-   Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

## R essentials (continued)

-   Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

dataframe$var_name
```

. . .

-   Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

?mean
```

## tidyverse

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

-   The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar

# Quarto

## Quarto {.center}

::: incremental
-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the analysis is ran from the beginning
-   Code goes in chunks narrative goes outside of chunks
-   A visual editor for a familiar / Google docs-like editing experience
:::

## Tour recap: Quarto

![](images/tour-quarto.png){fig-alt="RStudio IDE with a Quarto document, source code on the left and output on the right. Annotated to show the YAML, a link, a header, and a code chunk." fig-align="center"}

## Environments {.center}

::: callout-important
The environment of your Quarto document is separate from the Console!
:::

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work with Quarto!

## Environments

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
First, run the following in the console:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

x <- 2
x * 3
```

<br>

::: fragment
All looks good?
:::
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
Then, add the following in an R chunk in your Quarto document

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

x * 3
```

<br>

::: fragment
What happens? Why the error?

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every class activity, problem set, project, etc. is an Quarto document
-   You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with
-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
