Calculate the actual difference-in-means in our sample.\n    2.  Permute the treatment assignment the same way you originally assigned treatment and calculate the difference-in-means.\n    3.  Repeat step 2 many times.\n    4.  Compare the actual difference-in-means to the distribution of differences-in-means under the sharp null.\n    5.  The p-value is the proportion of permuted differences-in-means that are as extreme or more extreme than the actual difference-in-means.\n",
