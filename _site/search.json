    "text": "Course Structure\nThe basic cadence of the course will be as follows, though there may be small differences depending on the week:\n\nMonday: Complete reading, watch course lectures, and complete tutorial.\nTuesday: Class meets.\nWednesday: Submit assignments (if due)\nThursday: Class meets; assignments are posted\n\n\nClass Lectures\nClass lectures will be recorded and posted on the course website. You are expected to watch the lectures before class meetings on Tuesdays. At class meetings, there will be an opportunity to ask questions about lecture material.\n\n\nTutorials\nWe will assign short weekly tutorials that will assess your knowledge of the class materials and prepare you for the in-class activities. Tutorials will primarily be graded based on completion and not whether the answers are correct. Tutorials will generally be due on Monday by 11:59pm ET.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nCompetence at the design and analysis of experiments and surveys requires practice with real world datasets and the design of simulations. For the first 2/3 of the course, I will assign problem sets that will give you the opportunity to practice the methods I learn in the course. The problem sets will often involve the creation of a simulation and/or the analysis of data from an assigned reading.\nI will assign six problem sets throughout the semester. They will be due on Wednesdays by 11:59pm ET. I encourage students to work in groups, but each student must submit their own assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowest Homework Grade is Dropped\n\n\n\nWhen calculating the overall homework grade, I will drop the lowest homework grade. This is to account for unexpected events that may prevent you from completing an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe will use Piazza for class discussions. If you are having trouble with a question on a problem set or on a reading, please post your question using Piazza. I strongly encourage students to assist in answering questions as they come up. Except under unusual circumstances, it is better to post on Piazza than email me as everyone can benefit from the posted responses. I will monitor Piazza and try to answer within 24 hours.
