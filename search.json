    "text": "Course Objectives\nMany of the most pressing social problems have political causes and consequences. Rather than just passively observing these problems, social scientists have developed a range of tools that involve interventions and data collection to understand and address these problems. This course will focus on two essential data-intensive tools for understanding social dynamics: experiments and surveys. Experiments allow us to understand the causal effects of policies and interventions, while surveys allow us to measure difficult-to-observe attitudes and behaviors in a population. This course will provide an introduction to the design and analysis of experiments and surveys through the lens of innovative research in political science and public policy. The course will focus on various substantive topics, including discriminatory attitudes, political participation, combatting voter fraud, and misinformation. Students will analyze actual data and design and field their survey experiment on a chosen topic.\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe how experimental and survey methods can be used to understand pressing social problems.\nDesign surveys and experiments that are applicable to a variety of social settings.\nUse statistical principles to evaluate the quality of survey and experimental designs.\nApply statistical models to experimental and survey data.\nAnalyze data using modern statistical computing tools, in particular the statistical programming language R.\n\n\nExpectations\nIn this course, you will be expected to:\n\nComplete six problem sets.\nComplete regular reading quizzes.\nComplete eight weekly tutorials.\nParticipate in in-person and online class discussions.\nDesign and implement a survey experiment with a diverse sample.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prerequisites will be assumed."

In addition to in-class lectures, I may occasionally post a recorded lecture. During lecture, we will often be working with data and code, so please bring a computer to class, if possible.\n\n\nTutorials\nWe will assign short weekly coding tutorials that will assess your knowledge of the class materials and prepare you for the in-class activities. Tutorials will primarily be graded based on completion and not whether the answers are correct. Tutorials will generally be due on Wednesday by 11:59pm ET.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nCompetence at the design and analysis of experiments and surveys requires practice with real world datasets and the design of simulations. For the first 2/3 of the course, I will assign problem sets that will give you the opportunity to practice the methods you learn in the course. The problem sets will often involve the creation of a simulation and/or the analysis of data from an assigned reading. In the second half of the course, substantial parts of the problem set will be devoted to the design of the class project.\nI will assign six problem sets throughout the semester. They will be due on Thursdays by 11:59pm ET. I encourage students to work in groups, but each student must submit their own assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowest Homework Grade is Dropped\n\n\n\nWhen calculating the overall homework grade, I will drop the lowest homework grade. This is to account for unexpected events that may prevent you from completing an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Forum\nWe will use Piazza for class discussions. If you are having trouble with a question on a problem set or on a reading, please post your question using Piazza. I strongly encourage students to assist in answering questions as they come up. Except under unusual circumstances, it is better to post on Piazza than email me as everyone can benefit from the posted responses. I will monitor Piazza and try to answer within 24 hours. The site is: https://piazza.com/mit/spring2024/17831/home\n\n\nGrading\nThe final grade in the course will be based on the following components:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nCoding Tutorials\n5%\n\n\nReading Quizzes\n5%\n\n\nProblem Sets\n50%\n\n\nClass Participation\n25%\n\n\nClass Project Writeup\n15%\n\n\n\nClass participation is based on participation in class discussions, presentations, and activities, as well as participation in Piazza discussions."

The goal of this project is to give students experience crafting a research design and collecting real data on a question of interest. The data will be collected on US adults through a crowd-sourcing platform. While we will collectively design the survey and experiment, each student will be responsible for pre-registering their analysis, analyzing the data and writing up the results on their own.\nStudents in the class will:\n\nPropose a research question.\nDesign an intervention suitable for a survey experiment.\nWrite a questionnaire.\nDesign a sampling plan and analysis strategy sufficient for answering their research question.\nPre-register their study.\nAnalyze and write up the results of the study."

However, a central goal of the class is to help you become independent and critical thinkers, so we discourage you from the extensive use of generative AI tools for writing code or answers to problem sets.\nIf you do use AI-generated content in your assignments, you must clearly indicate what work is yours and what part is AI-generated through proper attribution. We also ask you provide a short one-paragraph summary at the beginning of the assignment on how you used AI tools."

In the paper, they compare estimates using these two measurement strategies for a variety of topics. We will look at the following two topics:\n\nOpposition to Muslim public school teachers\nWhether someone watches CNN\n\nThe list_df data includes the following variables:\n\nmuslim_list_treat and cnn_list_treat: treatment indicators for the two experiments\nmuslim_list_N and cnn_list_N: the number of items in the list counted by respondent\nmuslims_direct and cnn_direct: direct question responses where 1 = yes and 0 = no.\n\n\nProblem 1(a)\nExplain the intuition behind the list experiment design and how it can be used to estimate the prevalence of sensitive attitudes. What are the pros and cons of this approach? Think about the two issues we are focusing on here, why might the researchers have chosen to use a list experiment?\n\n\nProblem 1(b)\nUsing list_df, calculate the direct and indirect attitude estimates for each of the two behaviors. Additionally, calculate 95% confidence intervals for each of the estimates using a bootstrap. Plot your results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAt the start of your code chunk, please include set.seed(1234). This allows for the results that rely on random sampling (i.e.a bootstrap) to be reproducible.\n\n\n\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nProblem 1(c)\nNow interpret the results from your plot:\n\nHow do the estimates from the list experiment compare to the direct question estimates? What do you think might explain the differences between the two estimates?\nWhat about the uncertainty estimates? Interpret the confidence intervals and compare them between estimates.\n\n\n\nProblem 1(d)\nWhat might these results tell us about the trade-offs between the two measurement strategies? Think about both the point estimates and the uncertainty estimates."

    "text": "Problem 2\nIn this second problem, we will analyze data from another paper:\n\nGraham, Mathew H. and Alexander Coppock. “ASKING ABOUT ATTITUDE CHANGE” Public Opinion Quarterly(2021): 28-53. https://doi:10.1093/poq/nfab009.\n\nGraham and Coppock (2021) critique a widely used method for measuring attitude change in surveys. Social scientists or survey researchers are often interested in how new information may or may not change attitudes. One way to test this involves using what Graham and Coppock call a change format question. These questions often take the following structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: President Obama issued an executive order banning the CIA and other government organizations from torturing detainees.\nHow does this change your support for banning the CIA and other government organizations from torturing detainees? Less supportive, no difference, more supportive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: President Trump issues an executive order that reduced restrictions on coal ash disposal.\nHow does this change your support for strict regulations on the disposal of coal ash, the pollutant left over after power plants burn coal? Less supportive, no difference, more supportive\n\n\n\nThis strategy essentially asks respondents to evaluate the causal effect of new information on their attitudes. Graham and Coppock argue that this strategy produces inflated estimates of attitude change. As an alternative, they propose a counterfactual format. This proposed question format has the following structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: President Obama issued an executive order banning the CIA and other government organizations from torturing detainees.\nDo you support or oppose banning the CIA and other government organizations from torturing detainees? Oppose, Support\nPart 2: Imagine that you did not know that President Obama issued an executive order banning the CIA and other government organizations from torturing detainees.\nHow could you have answered the question: Do you support or oppose banning the CIA and other government organizations from torturing detainees? Oppose, support\n\n\n\nThis alternative method involves two steps: first respondents are reminded of the new information and asked to report their attitude as in the standard survey question. Second, respondents are then asked to imagine how they would have responded had they not known the new information.\n\nProblem 2(a)\nCritically evaluate these two question formats. What are some possible issues with the change question? How does the counterfactual format improve on these issues? Are there any downsides or remaining problems with the counterfactual format?\n\n\nProblem 2(b)\nFor this question we will use the attitude_df data frame. This data includes the following variables:\n\nParty: Respondent party identification\nFormat : The question format used to measure attitude change (Change or Counterfactual)\ntreat: Treatment indicator for the Counterfactual format\nYC: Combined outcome variable for both question formats\nY: Outcome variable for the first stage of the Counterfactual format\ntau_i_tilde: Individual level treatment effect of the Counterfactual format\n\nWe are going to compare the effectiveness of the two question formats in measuring attitude change. To do this, we will be using one of the experiments conducted by Graham and Coppock focused on the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Respondents were told whether or not their Senator opposed Kavanaugh and then asked how that information changes the likelihood of supporting the Senator. To start, plot the distribution of responses in both the Change and the Counterfactual formats by Party ID. Figure 5 in the paper can be a useful guide for this plot.\n\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nProblem 2(c)\nNow we are going to take advantage of how the counterfactual format is designed to compare differences in the estimates of attitude change by Party ID. Subjects shown the counterfactual format are randomly assigned to a treatment and control group. Here is the question wording for each group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nSenator [full name], a [Democrat / Republican] from [respondent’s state], [is running for/ will be up for] re-election in [2018 / 2020/ 2022].\nWill you support [last name] or [her / his] [Republican / Democratic] opponent?\nDefinitely oppose [last name], Probably oppose, Lean toward opposing, Lean toward supporting, Probably support, Definitely support [last name]\n(New Page) ——\n[Last name] voted against Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Before the vote, three women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\nIf you had known this information, how would you have answered the question:\nWill you support [last name] or [her / his] [Democratic / Republican] opponent?\nDefinitely oppose [last name], Probably oppose, Lean toward opposing, Lean toward supporting, Probably support, Definitely support [last name]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nSenator [full name], a [Democrat / Republican] from [respondent’s state], [is running for/ will be up for] re-election in [2018 / 2020/ 2022].\n[Last name] voted against Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Before the vote, three women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\nWill you support [last name] or [her / his] [Democratic / Republican] opponent?\nDefinitely oppose [last name], Probably oppose, Lean toward opposing, Lean toward supporting, Probably support, Definitely support [last name]\n(New Page) ——\nImagine you did not know that [last name] voted [for / against] Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court after allegation of sexual assault.\nHow would you have answered the question:\nWill you support [last name] or [her / his] [Democratic / Republican] opponent?\nDefinitely oppose [last name], Probably oppose, Lean toward opposing, Lean toward supporting, Probably support, Definitely support [last name]\n\n\n\nHere is a diagram of the research design:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start Survey] --&gt; B[Control]\n  B --&gt; C[Do you support a challenger to your Senator?] \n  C --&gt; D[Information about Kavanaugh vote]\n  D --&gt; E[How would you have answered this question &lt;br/&gt; if you had know this information?]\n  \n  A --&gt; F[Treatment]\n  F --&gt; G[Information about Kavanaugh vote]\n  G --&gt; H[Do you support a challenger to your Senator?] \n  H --&gt; I[Imagine you did not know that information, how &lt;br/&gt; would you have answered the question?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the control condition, respondents are first asked to report whether they support a challenger to their Senator (\\(Y_i(0)\\)). Next, they are presented information about how their Senator opposed Kavanaugh as well as about the allegations against Kavanaugh. They were then asked how they would have answered the initial question if they had known this information (\\(\\tilde{Y_i(1)}\\)). We call this outcome \\(\\tilde{Y_i(1)}\\) because we are asking respondents to guess at their own potential outcome under treatment. Remember, we can never truly observe both potential outcomes. This design provides a best guess.\nIn the treatment condition, respondents are presented the information about the Kavanuagh vote and are asked whether they support a challenger to their Senator (\\(Y_i(1)\\)). Next, respondents are asked to imagine they had not known about their Senators opposition and the allegations and asked how they would have answered the initial question (\\(\\tilde{Y_i(0)}\\)). Again, this is \\(\\tilde{Y_i(0)}\\) because we are asking respondents to guess at their own potential outcome under control.\nAssuming respondent’s guesses about their counterfactual attitudes are correct, then \\(\\tilde{Y_i(1)} = Y_i(1)\\) and \\(\\tilde{Y_i(0)} = Y_i(0)\\). Denoting \\(D\\) as the treatment indicator, we can calculate individual level treatment effects:\n\\[(\\tilde{\\tau_i}|D=0) = E[\\tilde{Y_i(1)} - Y_i(0)] \\] \\[(\\tilde{\\tau_i}|D=1) = E[Y_i(1) - \\tilde{Y_i(0)}]\\]\nWe can then use these individual level treatment effects to calculate the average treatment effect:\n\\[ATE_{CF} = \\frac{\\sum^N_i\\tilde{\\tau_i}}{N}\\]\nTo start, use attitude_df to calculate the difference in means for the first stage of the Counterfactual format for each party. This calculation ignores the additional information from the counterfactual guesses. In other words, here you are calculating the average difference in in support for a Senate challenger based on whether they saw information on support for Kavanaugh. To calculate this, use the variable Y in the data frame. Report the point estimates with 95% confidence intervals calculated using a bootstrap.\n\n# Your code here\n\nNow calculate the average treatment effect for each party using tau_i_tilde as the outcome variable. This calculation takes into account the full experimental design and counterfactual guesses. Report the point estimates with a 95% confidence intervals calculated using a bootstrap.\n\n# Your code here\n\nNext, calculate the difference between these two estimates. In other words, you are calculating the difference between the first-stage difference-in-means and the counterfactual average treatment effect. Report the point estimate and a 95% confidence interval calculated using a bootstrap.\n\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nProblem 2(d)\nPlot all three point estimates with 95% confidence intervals in a single plot. Interpret the results of your plot. Be sure to interpret both the point estimates and confidence intervals. Are the two estimates different? What does the difference between the estimates tell us? What do the results say about the validity of the two different question formats? Are you persuaded by Graham and Coppock’s proposed question format?\n\n# Your code here"

Blacks should do the same without any special favors.\nGenerations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class.\nOver the past few years, Blacks have gotten less than they deserve\nIt’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if Blacks would only try harder, they could be just as well off as whites."
