    "text": "Course Objectives\nMany of the most pressing social problems have political causes and consequences. Rather than just passively observing these problems, social scientists have developed a range of tools that involve interventions and data collection to understand and address these problems. This course will focus on two essential data-intensive tools for understanding social dynamics: experiments and surveys. Experiments allow us to understand the causal effects of policies and interventions, while surveys allow us to measure difficult-to-observe attitudes and behaviors in a population. This course will provide an introduction to the design and analysis of experiments and surveys through the lens of innovative research in political science and public policy. The course will focus on various substantive topics, including discriminatory attitudes, political participation, combatting voter fraud, and misinformation. Students will analyze actual data and design and field their survey experiment on a chosen topic.\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe how experimental and survey methods can be used to understand pressing social problems.\nDesign surveys and experiments that are applicable to a variety of social settings.\nUse statistical principles to evaluate the quality of survey and experimental designs.\nApply statistical models to experimental and survey data.\nAnalyze data using modern statistical computing tools, in particular the statistical programming language R.\n\n\nExpectations\nIn this course, you will be expected to:\n\nComplete six problem sets.\nComplete regular reading quizzes.\nComplete eight weekly tutorials.\nParticipate in in-person and online class discussions.\nDesign and implement a survey experiment with a diverse sample.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prerequisites will be assumed."

In addition to in-class lectures, I may occasionally post a recorded lecture. During lecture, we will often be working with data and code, so please bring a computer to class, if possible.\n\n\nTutorials\nWe will assign short weekly coding tutorials that will assess your knowledge of the class materials and prepare you for the in-class activities. Tutorials will primarily be graded based on completion and not whether the answers are correct. Tutorials will generally be due on Wednesday by 11:59pm ET.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nCompetence at the design and analysis of experiments and surveys requires practice with real world datasets and the design of simulations. For the first 2/3 of the course, I will assign problem sets that will give you the opportunity to practice the methods you learn in the course. The problem sets will often involve the creation of a simulation and/or the analysis of data from an assigned reading. In the second half of the course, substantial parts of the problem set will be devoted to the design of the class project.\nI will assign six problem sets throughout the semester. They will be due on Thursdays by 11:59pm ET. I encourage students to work in groups, but each student must submit their own assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowest Homework Grade is Dropped\n\n\n\nWhen calculating the overall homework grade, I will drop the lowest homework grade. This is to account for unexpected events that may prevent you from completing an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Forum\nWe will use Piazza for class discussions. If you are having trouble with a question on a problem set or on a reading, please post your question using Piazza. I strongly encourage students to assist in answering questions as they come up. Except under unusual circumstances, it is better to post on Piazza than email me as everyone can benefit from the posted responses. I will monitor Piazza and try to answer within 24 hours. The site is: https://piazza.com/mit/spring2024/17831/home\n\n\nGrading\nThe final grade in the course will be based on the following components:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nCoding Tutorials\n5%\n\n\nReading Quizzes\n5%\n\n\nProblem Sets\n50%\n\n\nClass Participation\n25%\n\n\nClass Project Writeup\n15%\n\n\n\nClass participation is based on participation in class discussions, presentations, and activities, as well as participation in Piazza discussions."

In the second half of the semester, we will devote time each week to design the survey and experiment. The goal of this project is to give students experience crafting a research design and collecting real data on a question of interest. The data will be collected on US adults through a crowd-sourcing platform. While we will collectively design the survey and experiment, each student will be responsible for pre-registering their analysis, analyzing the data and writing up the results on their own.\nStudents in the class will:\n\nPropose a research question.\nDesign an intervention suitable for a survey experiment.\nWrite a questionnaire.\nDesign a sampling plan and analysis strategy sufficient for answering their research question.\nPre-register their study.\nAnalyze and write up the results of the study."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn this problem set, we will analyze data from the following paper, published by a former MIT graduate student:\n\nLowe, Matt. “Types of Contact: A Field Experiment on Collaborative and Adversarial Caste Integration.” American Economic Review 111, no. 6 (June 2021): 1807–44. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20191780.\n\nAn overview of the paper that I recommend you read is available at the following link: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/promoting-intercaste-harmony-through-sports\nThis field experiment was conducted in India and designed to test how different types of contact between members of different castes affects social relations. Like the Mousa paper, this study uses sports—in this case cricket—to create opportunities for sustained contact between members of different groups. The study took place in localities where residents tended to be segregated by caste and where cross-caste interactions were rare.\nWhile on a similar topic as the Mousa paper, the Lowe study has several additional components to the research design. The three main treatment arms that individual cricket players were randomly assigned to are:\n\nHomogenous teams: Assignment to a team with only members of the same caste.\nMixed teams: Assignment to a team with at least 1 team-mate from a different caste. Note that the proportion of players from different castes on the team was also randomly varied.\nPure Control: Members of the control group were not assigned to a team and did not play in the local league.\n\nIn addition to these treatment arms, the 8 matches in each tournament were randomly constructed. This second element of randomization created variation in the proportion of players from other castes that each player played against. Lowe argues that this variation can be used to test the effect of adversarial contact, which may have different effects than collaborative contact.\nIn this problem set, we will explore both forms of contact. You will use data visualization to both assess the validity of the design and to explore the effects of the treatment.\nThe pset1_data data includes the following variables:\n\ntreat_cond: whether or not the player was assigned to pure control (control), mixed teams (team_mix), or homogenous teams (team_hom).\nprop_teammates_other_caste: for players on a team, the proportion of teammates from a different caste. For players not on a team, this variable is coded as missing (NA).\nbins_teammates_other_caste: a categorical version of prop_teammates_other_caste that divides the variable into 4 bins: “0-25%”, “25-50%”, “50-75%”, and “75-100%”.\nprop_opponents_other_caste: the proportion of opponents from a different caste.\nbins_opponents_other_caste: a categorical version of prop_opponents_other_caste that divides the variable into 10 quantile bins.\nbin_midpoint_opponents: the midpoint of the bin for prop_opponents_other_caste.\nbaseline_prop_other_caste_nbrs: the proportion of neighbors from a different caste as measured before assignment to teams.\nbaseline_bowl_test_speed: Maximum bowling speed in the pre-tournament test.\nn_other_caste_friends: After the conclusion of the tournaments, respondents were shown photos of all other players in their league and asked to identify those they considered friends. This variable measures the number of named friends from other castes.\nn_other_caste_future_friends: This post-tournament variable measures the number of players from other castes that the respondent is currently friends with or who they would like to be friends with."

What is the role of this group in the research design? What questions does it allow the researchers to answer that the two arm design used by Mousa does not?\n\n\nProblem 2\nLet’s examine if the randomization was successful. The first step is to examine whether players assigned to the different treatment arms are similar in terms of observable characteristics.\nWe will focus on the following two variables:\n\nbaseline_prop_other_caste_friends\nbaseline_bowl_test_speed\n\nUsing ggplot2, recreate the following box plot for each of the two variables. This plot was generated using fake data, but you should use the real data from the Lowe study. You might take a look at the geom_boxplot function in the ggplot2 documentation to get started.\n\nWhat can you conclude about the extent to which the design created comparable groups?\n\n\nProblem 3\nBox plots like the ones you created in Problem 2 are useful for comparing the distribution of a variable across different groups. An alternative way to compare the distribution of a variable across groups is to use a density plot.\nUsing ggplot2, create a density plot for the variable baseline_prop_other_caste_nbrs for each of the three treatment arms. Overlay the densities from each group over each other, but use different colors to distinguish each group.\n\n\nProblem 4\nEstimate the average treatment effect of being assigned to a mixed or homogenous team (relative to the control group) on n_other_caste_friends and n_other_caste_future_friends. Report these estimates in a figure or a table. What do these estimates suggest about the effect of playing on a homogenous team and the effect of playing on a mixed caste team?\n\n\nProblem 5\nThe Lowe paper also examines the effect of the proportion of teammates from other castes on the number of friends from other castes. Calculate the average of n_other_caste_future_friends for each of the four bins of prop_teammates_other_caste.\nReport these averages in a figure or a table. What do these averages suggest about the effect of the proportion of teammates from other castes on the number of friends from other castes? Does this analysis tell you something different from the analysis in Problem 4?\n\n\nProblem 6\nNow let’s examine the effect of the proportion of opponents from other castes on the number of friends from other castes. Calculate the average of n_other_caste_future_friends for each of the ten quantile bins of prop_opponents_other_caste. Plot these averages against the midpoint of each quantile bin (bin_midpoint_opponents).\nWhat does this plot suggest about the effect of “adversarial” contact? Given the collective results of the experiment, how should we think about the “contact hypothesis”?"
