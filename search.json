    "text": "Course Objectives\nMany of the most pressing social problems have political causes and consequences. Rather than just passively observe these problems, social scientists have developed a range of tools that involve interventions and data collection to understand and address these problems. In this course, we will focus on two of the most important data-intensive tools for understanding social dynamics: experiments and surveys. Experiments allow us to understand the causal effects of policies and interventions, while surveys allow us to measure difficult-to-observe attitudes and behaviors in a population. This course will provide an introduction to the design and analysis of experiments and surveys through the lens of innovative research in political science and public policy. Substantively, the course will focus on a range of topics including discriminatory attitudes, political participation, combatting voter fraud, and misinformation. Students will analzye real data and design and field their own survey experiment on a topic of their choosing.\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe how experimental and survey methods can be used to understand pressing social problems.\nDesign surveys and experiments that are applicable to a variety of social settings.\nUse statistical principles to evaluate the quality of survey and experimental designs.\nApply statistical models to experimental and survey data.\nAnalyze data using modern statistical computing tools, in particular the statistical programming language R.\n\n\nExpectations\nIn this course, you will be expected to:\n\nComplete six problem sets.\nComplete regular reading quizzes.\nComplete eight weekly tutorials.\nParticipate in in-person and online class discussions.\nDesign and implement a survey experiment with a diverse sample.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prerequisites will be assumed."

You are expected to watch the lectures before class meetings on Tuesdays. At class meetings, there will be an opportunity to ask questions about lecture material and readings\n\n\nTutorials\nWe will assign short weekly coding tutorials that will assess your knowledge of the class materials and prepare you for the in-class activities. Tutorials will primarily be graded based on completion and not whether the answers are correct. Tutorials will generally be due on Wednesday by 11:59pm ET.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nCompetence at the design and analysis of experiments and surveys requires practice with real world datasets and the design of simulations. For the first 2/3 of the course, I will assign problem sets that will give you the opportunity to practice the methods you learn in the course. The problem sets will often involve the creation of a simulation and/or the analysis of data from an assigned reading. In the second half of the course, substantial parts of the problem set will be devoted to the design of the class project.\nI will assign six problem sets throughout the semester. They will be due on Thursdays by 11:59pm ET. I encourage students to work in groups, but each student must submit their own assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowest Homework Grade is Dropped\n\n\n\nWhen calculating the overall homework grade, I will drop the lowest homework grade. This is to account for unexpected events that may prevent you from completing an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Forum\nWe will use Piazza for class discussions. If you are having trouble with a question on a problem set or on a reading, please post your question using Piazza. I strongly encourage students to assist in answering questions as they come up. Except under unusual circumstances, it is better to post on Piazza than email me as everyone can benefit from the posted responses. I will monitor Piazza and try to answer within 24 hours. The site is: https://piazza.com/mit/spring2024/17831/home\n\n\nGrading\nThe final grade in the course will be based on the following components:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nCoding Tutorials\n5%\n\n\nReading Quizzes\n5%\n\n\nProblem Sets\n50%\n\n\nClass Participation\n25%\n\n\nClass Project Writeup\n15%\n\n\n\nClass participation is based on participation in class discussions, presentations, and activities, as well as participation in Piazza discussions."

The goal of this project is to give students experience crafting a research design and collecting real data on a question of interest. The data will be collected on US adults through a crowd-sourcing platform. While we will collectively design the survey and experiment, each student will be responsible for pre-registering their analysis, analyzing the data and writing up the results on their own.\nStudents in the class will:\n\nPropose a research question.\nDesign an intervention suitable for a survey experiment.\nWrite a questionnaire.\nDesign a sampling plan and analysis strategy sufficient for answering their research question.\nPre-register their study.\nAnalyze and write up the results of the study."

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nLate Policy\nFor problem sets submitted late, we will deduct 10% of the grade for each day late. Problem sets will not be accepted more than three days after the due date. This penalty will be waived in the case of a documented medical or family emergency.\n\n\nOffice Hours and Getting Help\nI hold regular weekly office hours on Friday afternoons. Please sign up for in-person or zoom office hours at the following link: https://fantastical.app/dhidalgo/office-hours.\nIf you run into problems that you can’t solve on your own, please use the class website on Piazza to post questions. I strongly encourage students to assist in answering questions as they come up. Unless absolutely necessary, it is better to post on Piazza than email me as everyone can benefit from the posted responses. I will monitor Piazza and try to answer within 24 hours.\n\n\nAI Tools\nThe use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT is allowed for your assignments in this class. However, a central goal of the class is to help you become independent and critical thinkers, so we discourage you from the extensive use of generative AI tools for writing code or answers to problem sets.\nIf you do use AI-generated content in your assignments, you must clearly indicate what work is yours and what part is AI-generated through proper attribution. We also ask you provide a short one-paragraph summary at the beginning of the assignment on how you used AI tools."

Green. Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation. New York London: W. W. Norton & Company, 2012.\n\n\n\n\nComputing\nWe will use R for all of the data analysis in this course. R is a free, open-source statistical programming language that is widely used in the social sciences. We will use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) to write and execute R code. RStudio is also free and open-source.\nYou should install R on your own computer, but to forestall any installation problems, we will provide the option to use the Posit Cloud service for the first few weeks of the course. This service allows you to run R and RStudio in your web browser. This cloud service can be resource constrained, however, so it is strongly recommended that you install R and RStudio on your own computer as soon as possible."
